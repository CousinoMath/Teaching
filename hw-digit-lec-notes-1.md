# Handwritten, Digital Lecture Notes: A First Attempt #

## Motivation ##

Ever since I&rsquo;ve been presented with the idea of posting lecture notes
online prior to class, I&rsquo;ve wanted to try it. First, I tried recording
lectures and posting them to YouTube. But with the version of
Blackboard that I had available to me, I couldn&rsquo;t track which students
specifically were watching the videos. This was bad for me as a teacher
and as a data mining research in math education. Typing up lecture
notes in Microsoft Word or OneNote would be too time consuming due to
all the equations and graphs that would have to be created. So this is
my next attempt at providing my students with lecture notes prior to
class.

## Methodology ##

### Setup ###

I am writing my notes in Microsoft OneNote 2013 on a Lenovo Yoga Pad
(Intel Core i7 4500U, 8GB RAM) running Windows 10 Pro. This hardware is
a 2-in-1 laptop and tablet, which means that the screen has capacitive
touch recognition. The stylus that I&rsquo;m using is an Adonit Jot Pro. I
took lecture notes for the first week of a college algebra class and a
business calculus class.

### Converting handwriting to text ###

At first, I tried converting both my handwritting, both words and math,
into properly formatted text and formulas. There are two ways of doing
this conversion. First, within (paid versions of) OneNote, there are
buttons under the &ldquo;Draw&rdquo; tab to convert
&ldquo;Ink to Text&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ink to Math&rdquo;. The other
method uses the handwriting input panel (from the on-screen keyboard)
and the math input panel (which I found by searching or going into
&ldquo;Accessories&rdquo;). All conversions required some degree of
manual correction, the math conversions requiring the most. Out of all
of these methods, the handwriting input panel was perhaps the best due
to it taking a few words at a time. This meant that my errors could be
more easily detected and were quicker to correct due to the software
offering suggested corrections.

Once I dug through the settings and told the handwriting input panel to
allow me to write words one letter at a time, rather than altogether
with cursive writing, The handwriting became pretty accurate enough to
be usable. The mathematical handwriting was astonishing, but not good
enough to use regularly. I say this because recognizing mathematical
writing is another level of difficulty harder than regular writing.
With subscripts, superscripts, funny Greek letters, large fractions,
etc., Microsoft has done a great job with their math input panel.
It&rdquo;s just not finished yet. For some reason, the math input
thinks my &lsquo;0&rsquo;s are &lsquo;3&rsquo;s. I cannot write my
&lsquo;1&rsquo;s with the hat and stand serifs. And multiline equations
are out; so get used to equations that ride off the right hand side
rather than down the page.

### Just handwriting ###

The tedium of converting and correcting lead me to just leave my
handwriting as is. The troubles which I list in this section are
troubles that plagued every method. The first and primary problem that
I encountered was that of palm rejection on my setup. Because I&rsquo;m not
using a capacitive stylus, my laptop is unable to distinguish between
my stylus and my palm. So when I&rsquo;m lucky, my palms won&rsquo;t interfere with
my use of the stylus. But too often, my palms would create unwanted 
marks within OneNote or select another application to the foreground.
To avoid this, I would need to use something like a Wacom stylus or
switch to a Microsoft Surface and it&rsquo;s pen. Some other setup
where the device and stylus communicate through means other than
capacitive charge. This inability with my palm on the writing surface
forced me to write in an unfamiliar way, resulting in my handwriting
being worse than usual. Thus my mathematical writing was not as clean
as I would prefer. My graphs were too wobbly.

Also, the only way that I could draw in a thick dot was to manually
select a pen with a larger stroke size. Then I could dab a point onto
OneNote. This is a small complaint until you realize that drawing
points in math is rather common. Then this formatting change which
takes a few seconds starts to become a real nuisance.

The results should be up on my GitHub page.

## Conclusions ##

This is not going to continue with this setup. It&rsquo;s too tedious.
My plan for now is maybe LaTeX, until I get my Livescribe pen and paper
back. I&rsquo;m eying a Surface Pro 4 though. If it has the palm rejection,
the extra buttons on the pen promise to eliminate a lot of the tedium
of handwriting in OneNote.
