# Semantics of Variables #

I was talking to
[@misscalcul8](https://twitter.com/misscalcul8/status/666474645906944001)
about representations of linear inequalities. She viewed the solutions
of the inequalities as regions in the coordinate plane. She was
intrigued by representing the solutions as intervals on the number line.
This reminded me of the various semantic roles that variables play.

## Fixed, Unknown Value ##

This is the initial idea of a variable that we present to students.
Here, a variable has a particular, but unknown value. We can learn the
value of the variable by solving an equation. For example, under this
interpretation, the equation `\(2 x + 7 = 21\)` translates to the
question &ldquo;What number, call it `\(x\)`, when doubled and added to
7 equals 21?&rdquo; By solving the equation, we solve the mystery to
discover the value of `\(x\)` to be 7.

Whenever a variable is seen to have a fixed but unknown value, we try to
get the same result 

## Fixed, Arbitrary Value ##

## Varying Value ##

## Indeterminant Value ##
