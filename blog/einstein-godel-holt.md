   * Relative perception of time over age, childhood to old age
   * No now
   * Einstein's eternalist view of time
   * Fate of the universe
   * Boltzmann brains
3. Numbers Guy: The Neuroscience of Math
   * Author of "The Number Sense" ~Duwan~
   * "Approximate man"
   * Representation of numbers in the mind (number neurons)
4. Riemann Zeta Conjecture and the Laughter of the Primes
   * Copernican (Gott) principle: You are not special (within 95%)
     * n performances: between n/39 and 39*n more performances
   * Euclid's infinitude of primes
   * Zeta hypothesis

5. Gaulton: Father of Statistics and Father of Eugenics
   * Enduring factors: skill mix with Transient factors: luck combine in
     regression to the mean.
6. A Mathemtical Romance
   * Middle of 19th century, math shifted from science bound calculation to
     free creation of new structures/languages. Math proofs came to look like
     narratives with plots, subplots, twists, and revelations.
   * Symmetry group and Galois theory

   * Grothendick (sp?)
   * Bourbaki (sp?)
8. Benoit Mandelbrot
   * Financial markets are inherently unstable.

   * Life in more/fewer dimensions, string theory
10. A Comedy of Colors
   * Four color theorem
   * Epistomology of machine proofs
   * Outline of the proof: minimal criminals, unavoidable sets, reducible configurations
11. Infinite Visions: Georg Cantor versus David Foster Wallace
   * Zeno's paradoxes
   * Cantor's diagonal argument, "member of the groucho club?"
   * Book's compactness joke
