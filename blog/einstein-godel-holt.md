## Preamble ##

It's incredibly frustrating to see beauty where others do not. This isolation is
one of the main problems about studying mathematics. Whenever I answer the
question &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;, I expect my answer to immediately kill
this line of discussion. Not only do people have little idea about what I do,
they *hate* what I do. This is the isolation: what I love, others loathe. Where
I see deep, rich beauty, others cannot avert their eyes fast enough. This is why
attempts to popularize mathematics interest me. They offer me an opportunity to
connect with others, and those I love, over my life&rsquo;s passion.

# When Einstein Walked with G&ouml;del #

This book by Jim Holt is the best popularization of mathematics that I have yet
read. Not only is it approachable, but it does so while diving deep into the
mathematics. The fact that the average reader will miss some of the finer points
is alleviated by the fact that they are engaged. (Granted, this might be helped
with an audiobook, as the listeners complete attention isn&rsquo;t required.)

   - No now
   - Einstein's eternalist view of time
   - Fate of the universe
   - Boltzmann brains

   - Author of "The Number Sense" ~Duwan~
   - "Approximate man"
   - Representation of numbers in the mind (number neurons)
1. Riemann Zeta Conjecture and the Laughter of the Primes

1. A Mathemtical Romance
   - Middle of 19th century, math shifted from science bound
     calculation to free creation of new structures/languages. Math
     proofs came to look like narratives with plots, subplots, twists,
     and revelations.
