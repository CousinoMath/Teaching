## Preamble ##

It's incredibly frustrating to see beauty where others do not. This isolation is
one of the main problems about studying mathematics. Whenever I answer the
question &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;, I expect my answer to immediately kill
this line of discussion. Not only do people have little idea about what I do,
they *hate* what I do. This is the isolation: what I love, others loathe. Where
I see deep, rich beauty, others cannot avert their eyes fast enough. This is why
attempts to popularize mathematics interest me. They offer me an opportunity to
connect with others, and those I love, over my life&rsquo;s passion.

# When Einstein Walked with Gödel #

This book by Jim Holt is the best popularization of mathematics that I have yet
read. Not only is it approachable, but it does so while diving deep into the
mathematics. The fact that the average reader will miss some of the finer points
is alleviated by the fact that they are engaged. (Granted, this might be helped
with an audiobook, as the listeners complete attention isn&rsquo;t required.)
The book is a collection of essays by the author written in the style of
&ldquo;cocktail party chat with a few marks on a napkin.&rdquo;

After an introduction, the author starts with the titular essay. He describes
who Einstein and Gödel are, and how they became friends at Princeton. The
summary of their individual works is quite good. And the author mentions the
tale when Gödel presented Einstein with a birthday present of a model of a
spinning universe that allows for dopplegangers. The next chapter discusses the
nature of time in light of Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity, how the theory
precludes any synchroncous events which results in the lack of &ldquo;now&rdquo;
in time. Holt discusses Einstein&rsquo;s eternalist view of time and how it
fits with his theories.

In the fourth chapter, Holt discusses the Riemann Zeta hypothesis, which I found
stunning. What is even more impressive is that the author actually explains
what the hypothesis says. This is where Holt impressed me with the depth of his
coverage of mathematics. Some other topics that the book covers are:

- the neurscience of numbers and how our minds represent quantities through an
  examination of the work of Stanislas Dehaene, author of
  *The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics*.
- Sir Francis Gaulton as the father of statistics and eugenics. His eugenic
  dreams ultimately dashed due to the statistical concept of &ldquo;regression
  to the mean.&rdquo; And a look at modern day eugenics via genetic engineering.
- Grothendieck&rsquo;s work in category theory and how the unending chains of
  abstraction impact mathematicians ability to grasp truth.
- a discussion about why the Russians embraced the concept of infinity but the
  French did not. It posits that the fact that Russians that explored the
  infinite were mystics involved with a cult worshipping the name of god.
